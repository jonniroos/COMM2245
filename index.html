<h1>Jonni Roos</h1>
<h2>PROFILE</h2>
	I am currently residing in Farmington, NM. However, I spent the last 20 years living in Fairbanks, AK, so I consider it my hometown (though I wasn't born there). 
<h2>EDUCATION</h2>	
	This is the last year of my BA program in Strategic Communications. 
<h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>
	My background is in event planning and digital media. 
<h2>PROJECTS</h2>
	One day, I would like to launch a boutique social media promotion company geared towards small, local businesses. There are many businesses in my area that start off well but fail to capitalize on the success of their initial popularity. Integrating a media plan into their business in a timely manner could potentially increase their profitability.
